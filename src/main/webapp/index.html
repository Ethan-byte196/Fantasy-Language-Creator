    <p>Instructions: "Quest Objective: Unveil the Secrets of the Ancient Tongue</p>
    <p>Step 1: Decrypt the Alphabet. Seek the mystical runes that correspond to the letters of the common English
      alphabet. <br> Align each rune with its English counterpart to unlock the ancient knowledge.</p>
    <p>Step 2: Forge the Words. Speak the word you wish to transform, and let the arcane script weave its magic. <br>
      Behold as your word is reborn, crafted in the enchanting cadence of a long-forgotten tongue.</p>
    <p>Adventure forth, brave linguist, and uncover the wonders of your newly created fictional language!</p>
    <p>IMPORTANT: Choose CONSONANTS AS CONSONANTS and VOWELS AS VOWELS if you want a coherent language"</p>
