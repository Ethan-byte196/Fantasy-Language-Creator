    <pre>Instructions: "Quest Objective: Unveil the Secrets of the Ancient Tongue
    Step 1: Decrypt the Alphabet. Seek the mystical runes that correspond to the letters of the common English alphabet.
    Align each rune with its English counterpart to unlock the ancient knowledge.
    Step 2: Forge the Words. Speak the word you wish to transform, and let the arcane script weave its magic.
    Behold as your word is reborn, crafted in the enchanting cadence of a long-forgotten tongue.
    Adventure forth, brave linguist, and uncover the wonders of your newly created fictional language!
    IMPORTANT: Choose CONSONANTS AS CONSONANTS and VOWELS AS VOWELS if you want a coherent language"
